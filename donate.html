  <p>Unable to make a monetary donation? An excellent alternative is to show your support by sending Ukrainian refugees words of encouragement. I haven't come across many websites that accept these types of letters at the moment. The only one I found is <a href="https://www.lettersofloveglobal.com/letters-of-love-to-ukraine"> Lots of Letters for Ukraine</a>. However, they have a specific format and template that they require. If you prefer to use a different website or send the letter to someone you know directly, you are welcome to use this script as you wish. Feel free to customize it to suit your needs and the recipient's situation.</p>
