   <!-- Main intro paragraph -->
  <p class=introPara>Welcome to "Justice for Ukraine," a website fueled by the unwavering passion of a native Ukrainian who, after immigrating to the United States, remains committed to seeking justice for her homeland. My mission is to spread awareness about the ongoing tragedies in Ukraine, rooted in Russia's war crimes, and to shed light on the reasons behind this invasion and its irrationality. I believe that understanding the severity of this situation is crucial for all democratic and NATO countries, as it presents a significant national security threat. The aim for creating this platform was to provide safe and reliable ways to support Ukraine through donations, as well as access to fact-based news outlets to stay informed and updated. Together, let us work towards a just and secure future for Ukraine.</p>
